CCOW Roadmap:

Stage 1 - A helper program that allows users to locate the appropriate
classification code for a particular topic category. (First version completed Jan 28, 2012; Perl port finished Mar 15, 2103)

Stage 2 - A program to faciliatate collaboration between experts in various
fields to allow them to make suggestions for the remaining categories, vote
on the suggestions, and finalize the results of those decisions for use
by the helper application from Stage 1.

Stage 3 - Spider modules search engines can use to crawl the meta data
proposed by this project, to compile trusted authority repositories that
track false information or well-established sites, and to become trusted
authorities themselves.
