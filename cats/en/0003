		<p class="desc">Reference-ranked Search Engines (#0003) are search engines that index the full contents of a page and allow users to search based on a keyword query, possibly with modifiers to the keywords, such as a "domain:" modifier that would limit the search results to pages on a specific domain. Unlike Full-text Keyword Search Engines (#0001), a Reference-ranked Engine ranks pages for its results page based on the number of other sites linking to a page, possibly giving extra weight to links from highly-ranked sites. This method gives search results a pseudo-filter of crowdsourced relationship finding, but it opens an avenue for abuse by the organizing a small group of content generators to link to a specific page with unrelated link text. Several examples of this sort of abuse, for the purposes of either satire or character assassination, have already been seen on the Web.</p>
