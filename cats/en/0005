		<p class="desc">Community-edited Directories and Indices (#0005) are directories or lists that allow anyone to add a link to any site. However, unlike Open-submission Directories and Indices (#0004), Community-edited Directories and Indices have editors from the community, who either maintain sections of the directory or approve submissions before they can appear. The presence of these editors improves the signal-to-noise ratio and limits or eliminates abuse by link spammers.</p>
		<p class="example">An example of this type of site is <a href="http://www.dmoz.org">The Open Directory Project</a>.</p>
		<p class="subs">This type of site can contain subpages from its own category #0005 only.</p>
