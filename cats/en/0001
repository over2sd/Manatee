		<p class="desc">Full-text Keyword Search Engines (#0001) are search engines that index the full contents of a page and allow users to search based on a keyword query, possibly with modifiers to the keywords, such as a "domain:" modifier that would limit the search results to pages on a specific domain.</p>
		<p class="example">An example of this type of site is <a href="http://www.av.com/">AltaVista</a>.</p>
		<p class="subs">This type of site can contain subpages from categories #0001 and <a href="?lang=en&cowc=000x">#0004-#0007<a/>.</p>
