		<p class="desc">Open Submission Directories and Indices (#0004) or Free-for-all link pages, as they are more commonly known, are directories or lists that allow anyone to add a link to any site. Obviously, this can lead to abuse and a low signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
		<p class="example">An example of this type of site is not available at this time.</p>
		<p class="subs">This type of site can contain subpages from its own category #0004 only.</p>
