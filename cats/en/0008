		<p class="desc">Web site rings (#0008) are collections of sites from various domains joined together in a circular structure. To be a part of the webring, each site has a common navigation unit, which contains links to the next and previous sites. By clicking next (or previous) repeatedly, a surfer will eventually reach the first site again, which is the origin of the term Web ring. Web site rings are usually organized around a specific theme.</p>
		<p class="example">An example of this type of site is <a href="http://dir.webring.com/rw">WebRing</a>, which hosts site rings, such as this <a href="http://www.webring.com/hub?ring=railroadmodelweb">Model Railroad Webring</a>.</p>
		<p class="subs">This type of site can contain subpages from its own category #0008 only.</p>
