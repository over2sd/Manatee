		<p class="desc">Header Info Search Engines (#0002) are search engines that index the keywords and description in the &lt;meta&gt; tags in the head section of a page and allow users to search based on a keyword query. Most search engines do not use header info as the primary method of indexing pages, because abuse of keywords is widespread, but most engines do include some parsing of the header info in addition to their primary methods.</p>
