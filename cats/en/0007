		<p class="desc">Machine-compiled Directories and Indices (#0007) are directories or lists that are built by crawlers using heuristics or &lt;meta&gt; tags to determine the categorization of pages. However, the index may also be administered by human editors to improve quality. Categorization tags like the one described by this project may make this type of site more feasible.</p>
		<p class="example">An example of this type of site is not available at this time.</p>
		<p class="subs">This type of site can contain subpages from its own category #0007 only.</p>
